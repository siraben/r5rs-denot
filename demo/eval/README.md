# Paul Graham's Metacircular evaluator, constantly revisited

A metacircular evaluator is a great way to test special forms as they
are added.  This directory also serves as a sort of chronology of
`r5rs-denot`, from a version of `eval` written in pure core Scheme
(`eval.scm`), to a version of `eval` that uses `define`
(`eval-define.scm`).
